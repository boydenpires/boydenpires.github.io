        A frontend developer based in India with over 4 years of experience
        working on production web applications and scalable frontend systems. I
        focus on clean, intuitive interfaces, smooth interactions, and
        maintainable architecture, collaborating closely with designers and
        backend teams.
        <br /><br />
        Outside of work, I spend time playing guitar, still learning but enjoying
        the process.
